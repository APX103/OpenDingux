LOADING ROM FILES (.A78)
------------

If you want to load rom images in the virtual drive
of your emulator, you have to put your rom file
(with .zip or .a78 file extension) on your SD card
in the 'roms' directory. 

Then, while inside Atari 7800 emulator, just press
MENU to enter in the emulator main menu, choose
"Load ROM" and then using the file selector choose
one game file to load in your emulator. 

You can use the virtual keyboard in the file
requester menu to choose the first letter of the
game you search (it might be useful when you have
tons of games in the same folder). Entering several
time the same letter let you choose sequentially
files beginning with the given letter. You can use
the Run key of the virtual keyboard to launch the
rom.

CHEAT CODE (.CHT)
----------

You can use cheat codes with this emulator.  You
can add your own cheat codes in the cheat.txt file
and then import them in the cheat menu.  

All cheat codes you have specified for a game can
be save in a CHT file in 'cht' folder.  Those cheat
codes would then be automatically loaded when you
start the game.

The CHT file format is the following :
#
# Enable, Address, Value, Comment
#
1,36f,3,Cheat comment

Using the Cheat menu you can search for modified
bytes in RAM between current time and the last time
you saved the RAM. It might be very usefull to find
"poke" address by yourself, monitoring for example
life numbers.

To find a new "poke address" you can proceed as
follow :

Let's say you're playing Xevious and you want to
find the memory address where "number lives" is
stored.

. Start a new game in Xevious
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Choose Save Ram to save initial state of the
  memory. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan Old Value" field.  (for Xevious the 
  initial lives number is 4)
. Go back to the game and loose a life.
. Enter in the cheat menu. 
. Specify the number of lives you want to find in
  "Scan New Value" field.
  (for Xevious the lives number is now 3)
. In Add Cheat you have now one matching Address
  (for Xevious it's 1A6E)
. Specify the Poke value you want (for example 4) 
  and add a new cheat with this address / value.

The cheat is now activated in the cheat list and
you can save it using the "Save cheat" menu.

Let's enjoy Xevious with infinite life !!

COMMENTS
------------

You can write your own comments for games using the
"Comment" menu.  The first line of your comments
would then be displayed in the file requester menu
while selecting the given file name (roms,
keyboard, settings).


SETTINGS
------------

You can modify several settings value in the
settings menu of this emulator.  The following
parameters are available :

Sound enable : 
  enable or disable the sound

Display fps : 
  display real time fps value 

Speed limiter :
  limit the speed to a given fps value

Skip frame : 
  to skip frame and increase emulator speed

Render mode : 
  many render modes are available with different
  geometry that should covered all games
  requirements

Vsync : 
  wait for vertical signal between each frame
  displayed

Clock frequency : 
  DINGUX clock frequency, by default the value is
  set to 200Mhz, and should be enough for most of
  all games.

If you want to modify the default setting, you just
need to save the settings just after emulator
startup. Settings will be saved as default each
time you restart the emulator. You can do the same
for default key mapping and joystick settings.
 

JOYSTICK SETTINGS
------------

You can modify several joystick settings value in
the settings menu of this emulator.  The following
parameters are available :

Swap Analog/Cursor : 
 swap key mapping between DINGUX analog pad and
 Dingoo digital pad

Active Joystick :

Auto fire period : 
  auto fire period

Auto fire mode : 
  auto fire mode active or not

Auto fire button : 
  Toggle between Fire1 & Fire2 button


LOADING KEY MAPPING FILES
------------

For given games, the default keyboard mapping
between DINGUX Keys and Atari 7800 keys, is not
suitable, and the game can't be played on
DINGUX-7800.

To overcome the issue, you can write your own
mapping file. Using notepad for example you can
edit a file with the .kbd extension and put it in
the kbd directory.

For the exact syntax of those mapping files, save
the keyboard settings inside the emulator and have
a look on file presents in the kbd directory
(default.kbd etc ...).

After writting such keyboard mapping file, you can
load them using the main menu inside the emulator.

If the keyboard filename is the same as the rom
file (.a78) then when you load this rom file, the
corresponding keyboard file is automatically loaded!

You can now use the Keyboard menu and edit, load
and save your keyboard mapping files inside the
emulator. The Save option save the .kbd file in the
kbd directory using the "Game Name" as filename.
The game name is displayed on the right corner in
the emulator menu.


COMPILATION
------------

It has been developped under Linux FC9 using gcc
with DINGUX SDK.  All tests have been done using a
Dingoo with Dingux installed To rebuild the
homebrew run the Makefile in the src archive.

Enjoy,
